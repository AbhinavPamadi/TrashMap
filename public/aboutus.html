        <div class="feature">
          <h3>Real-Time Geolocation</h3>
          <p>
            The system will utilize GPS to display the nearest available
            dustbins to users. This feature encourages users to dispose of waste
            properly by guiding them to designated disposal sites, reducing
            littering and promoting cleaner environments.

        <div class="feature">
          <h3>Black Site Reporting</h3>
          <p>
            Users can report "black sites" or locations where garbage
            accumulation is common, such as illegal dumping areas or overflowing
            bins. This alerts local authorities or waste management teams,
            enabling them to take swift action to clean these areas and prevent
            further waste build-up.
          </p>

        <div class="feature">
          <h3>Finding Nearest Bins</h3>
          <p>
            One of the biggest challenges in proper waste disposal is simply
             not knowing where to throw your trash. Our platform solves this 
             by using real-time geolocation to help users find the nearest 
             available public bins. By making disposal points easily 
             accessible, we encourage responsible waste management and 
             reduce the chances of littering. Whether you're in a busy market,
              a residential area, or a public park, our system ensures that 
              you can quickly locate the closest bin and do your part in 
              keeping the surroundings clean.

        <div class="feature">
          <h3>Reward System</h3>
          <p>
            To incentivize responsible waste disposal, users will earn points
            each time they use the app's services, such as reporting black sites
            or properly disposing of waste. Once users accumulate 1000 points,
            they can redeem them for rewards like AICTE points (for students and
            professionals) or other benefits. This gamification approach
            encourages continuous engagement and fosters a culture of
            sustainability.
